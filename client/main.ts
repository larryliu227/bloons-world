/**
 * BLOONS WORLD — the client.
 *
 * The loop that ties input, the socket and the renderer together, and the one piece
 * of real netcode in the game:
 *
 *  - YOUR player is predicted locally. The server is authoritative, but waiting a
 *    round trip to start walking feels broken on any connection, so the same
 *    `step` the server runs is run here immediately and the server's answer is
 *    eased in rather than snapped to. You get instant response and still cannot
 *    walk anywhere the server disagrees with.
 *  - EVERYONE ELSE is interpolated between the last two snapshots, held
 *    INTERP_DELAY_MS in the past so there is always a pair to interpolate between.
 *    Drawing them at the newest position instead means stuttering on every late
 *    packet.
